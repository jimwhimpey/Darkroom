A big picture style Flickr photo browser.

Trying to fill a gap in Flickr's photo browsing.

[I Hardly Know Her](http://ihardlyknowher.com/) is so close but not quite there.

Also an exercise in learning Ruby, HAML, SASS and Sinatra.

Thanks to [toolmantim](http://github.com/toolmantim) for his guidance.

## To Do

* Set viewing
* Error handling for non public photos
* API registration
